This file contains some of the TODOs and future ideas about
this fork of the library that should be explored

Implementing callback functions:
	The idea is that at the bare minimum an event message will
	trigger a callback function for handling the event.
	Some things to think about:
	
	Should there be two event callbacks,
	one for each type of event data?

	Should there be callbacks for other things like receiving data

Router idea:
	Each sensor node starts at an id of 255 and gets assigned a new id
	from the gateway when it first gets on a network.

	Use the event bit or even the last unused bit
